# CellularNetworkTester

CNT is a Low-cost LTE Test Device for testing LTE Network Performance. This repository can be used to built a tester that emulates connecting multiple mobile devices to a network. Supplementary files also include a guide to use Parallel-ssh to simultaneously check network parameters between mobile device and server(s). This repository explicitly helps establish an interaction between sim7600x (4G HAT-B) module with Raspberry Pi Zero. CNT allows you to make a Raspberry Pi a Low-cost Cellular Test Device for testing 2G/3G/4G Network Performance. This project was designed for 4G performance.
